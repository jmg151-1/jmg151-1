## 🚀 About Me 
I am a data analyst with a background in Information Technology and Business Analytics, focused on transforming data into clear, actionable insights that support informed decision-making. I believe analytics is most valuable when it provides clarity, strengthens accountability, and helps organizations operate more effectively.

My experience includes validating data between warehouse systems and reporting tools, supporting data migration efforts, and building dashboards that communicate key performance metrics. I use SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize data, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and usability. I am comfortable writing complex queries, performing exploratory analysis, and designing dashboards that align data with business needs.

I approach analytics with structured thinking and curiosity, focusing on delivering insights that are reliable, relevant, and actionable.
